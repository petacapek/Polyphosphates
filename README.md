# Polyphosphates
This repository contains all code to and data from the two laboratory experiments designed to explore presence, extractability and quantity of polyphosphates in biomass of soil microorganism. The experiments were conducted as a MSc. project and were financially supported by the Czech Science Foundation project no. 20-14704Y and 41-22-05421S.
# Navigation through repository folders and files
Most of the data are stored in file "MSCAdelData.csv". Legend to these data can be found in file "MSCAdelData_Legend.csv". Since the data were acquired as a part of MSC thesis at the Department of Ecosystem Biology, Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice, legend to data is in Czech.

File "PPdataAnalyses.R" contains code to evaluate the data. To run this file without errors, user further needs to estimate microbial comunity growth rates in medium without phosphorus from oxygen consumption data (i) and microscope pictures (ii):

(i) Oxygen consumption data and associated R code translating these data into growth rates can be found in folder "AdelRustovky".

(ii) Microscope pictures are too large to be uploaded here so they are available upon request.
